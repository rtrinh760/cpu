## CPU in VHDL

This project demonstrates the construction of a CPU including various components such as ROM, RAM, ALU, states, and more.

This allows us to create complex instructions with a variety of operations to choose from, such as ALU operations such as add, shift, move, etc. to memory operations such as loading from RAM, call/return, and push/pop.
